Our three objectives are:
1. Design and CAD a platform to hold the module and battery
2. Research material to seperate the nose cone from the body of the rocket
3. Design a platform to hold the camera at an optimal angle to maximize what is seen

Our sub-team recommendation is to use a 7x7" sheet of titanium to act as a boundary between the nose cone and the rest of the rocket.
We made our decision on the basis of titanium's cost and high melting point.

Each of the sub team members are working on specific parts of the interior design (to be assembled at a later date)
